    <center><h3>This is me !</h3></center>
    <center><i>I was born and raised in Chonburi, Thailand. Tuesday, September 9, 2003 was the day I woke up to see this bright world. In my childhood, I had many dreams of becoming a model, a gamer, and so on. But when I finally entered high school, I became interested in coding, but at that time I had not yet studied it. Seriously, because I think it's difficult. So I devoted my entire high school life to studying science and mathematics in the form of an international classroom curriculum. and graduated well. When I entered university, I entered to study in the Faculty of Environment(SEEN). University of Phayao But I still thought that it was still not my own path, so I decided to transfer to study in the Faculty of Technology and Information (ICT). Computer Science (SC) of the University of Phayao in the second year This was the first time I thought I was on the right track. Even though this journey will have many obstacles. I'll make it through just fine!
